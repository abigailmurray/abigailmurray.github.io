Abigail Murray Personal Website

About: 
This website was created for prospective community college students who were interested in majoring in computer science or a related computer technology major (such as computer engineering, software development, or data science). This website was started as a directed study project where I researched different majors relating to computer science as a way to increase my own understanding of the opportunities in the field. I additionally researched computer science-related careers in order to better help someone understand (potentially if they were already a computer science student) which career areas within the realm of computer science best fit them. 

I provided research pages on both majors and careers in computer science to help guide students. I additionally began to create a personalized quiz which took into account the student's interest, personality, skills, and relevant work experience into account and helped guide them to a few careers that would best fit them. This was similar to some career quizzes but different in the way that it was geared towards community college students who may not have had any experience in coding, and while it provided guidance on careers, half of the site also focused on majors. 

The directed study project has been an ongoing project I have worked on throughout my last year at Henry Ford College through my transition to Michigan State University (as well as from a HFC accounting student to MSU computer science student). It has helped me decide which areas of computer science I am interested in and I hope it can help others as well.
